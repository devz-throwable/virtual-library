# Virtual Library
This is a sample virtual library for the course 
Tech Management. This is the way to implement
Web 1.0. It's not about development, it's
about knowing how things work like
protocols, browsers and passing of data
from a user request, the server will respond
and will give the page through HTML together
with CSS.

## Rationale
Tech Management requires us to know at least 
how things work in the Tech field. 
Doing a simple hands-on like
this will further enhance it.

Again, this is Web 1.0. If you will be testing
this at the mobile browser, you will see
that it is responding but not fully. Fully
mobile responsive will require us to use 
framework, which we are avoiding. Well, it's
just an advanced one once you know this core.
Did you know that Bootstrap was developed
on Twitter, so that Twitter would be 
fully mobile-responsive as we are using it 
today ? But there is an alternative lightweight
framework for that, if you still want to pursue
this personally, the W3.CSS.

Web 2.0, on the other hand, will require
server-side scripting and fetching stored
data in a database, the CRUD operations.
There are so many available websites there, 
one is 

https://librarika.com/

that uses OPAC and all the services a Library
can offer.

What if you were asked in the interview
what you know about tech ? and how do you
integrate it in the Library ? or maybe
you will be asked to maintain a site of that
Library ? or maybe create one, like this.
And what if they are the only way to get hired
in that high-paying University, School or even
in the tech industry ? Seems it's all worth it.
We would never be able to predict that, 
the most important thing is you already know
it in the first place.

CTRL + A and copy, paste it either on Notepad
or online HTML compiler like JSFiddle

personally, I use VS Code for better experience
because I already have VS Code for software development,
you can install that too, open it and simply paste it there.
