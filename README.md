# Virtual Library Web 1.0
This is a sample virtual library for the course 
Tech Management. This is the way to implement
Web 1.0. It's not about development, it's
about knowing how things work like
protocols, browsers and passing of data
from a user request, the server will respond
and will give the page through HTML together
with CSS, the browser will render it
and boom ... you now have an elegant website.

## Rationale
Tech Management requires us to know at least 
how things work in the Tech field. 
Doing a simple hands-on like
this will further enhance it. It enhances
efficiency, reduces costs because we know
how systems work. 

Again, this is Web 1.0. If you will be testing
this at the mobile browser, you will see
that it is responding but not fully. Fully
mobile responsive will require us to use a
framework (and also JavaScript), 
which we are avoiding. Well, it's
just an advanced one once you know this core.

Did you know that Bootstrap was developed
by a team in Twitter, so that Twitter would be 
fully mobile-responsive as we are using it 
today ? That's how hard it is to achieve
the mobile responsiveness.
But there is an alternative lightweight
framework for that, if you still want to pursue
this personally, the W3.CSS

Web 1.0 really fits for the landing pages
of businesses or schools, like the samples
I presented last time. Even the PNU Library
landing page is a static website. It's cost-effective,
easy to be maintained and lightweight.

Web 2.0, on the other hand, will require
server-side scripting and doing CRUD
operations in the backend.
There are so many available websites there, 
one is 

https://librarika.com/

that uses OPAC and all the services a Library
can offer. For Web 2.0, you don't need to 
create your own system, because it's already
available even for free ( but there is no
such thing as free ). In short, you simply
use it.

Aside from being part of our course topic,
this is a preparation for your future career.
What if you are asked in the interview
what you know about tech ? and how do you
integrate it in the Library ? or maybe
you will be asked to maintain a site of that
Library ? or maybe create one, like this ?
And what if they are the only reasons 
for you to land a job ? Because applying for
high-paying jobs requires a lot of skills,
competition and retention is very high.
Seems it's all worth it.
We would never be able to predict that, 
the most important thing is you already knew
it in the first place. I would never be
hired as a software developer outside
the teaching field if I did not acquire
these skills too.

## Steps
Click the `index.html` and click view `raw`.

or simply click this link

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devz-throwable/virtual-library/main/index.html>

CTRL + A and copy, paste it either on Notepad
or online HTML compiler like JSFiddle

https://jsfiddle.net/

Personally, I use VS Code for better experience
because I already have VS Code for software development.
You can install that too, open it and simply paste it there.

And here is the deployed website on GitHub Pages

<https://devz-throwable.github.io/virtual-library/>

to view the rendered web page locally, save
the file as `index.html` and right click and open
it in Chrome.

To customize your own images and gifs, once you are
done designing your own, upload it publicly and 
simply get the image address, paste it at the 
intended target and you're done.

The Gallery, as you can see, only has three, I will
be requiring you to have 9, so you will need to have
another 2 rows containing 3 columns.
These are your personal
favorite books that you want to share with others. Originally,
every thumbnail in that library should be clickable and 
the user will be redirected to another page, but that 
will make it very complicated, so just the summary
of those books will do at the bottom, 
but according to your personal
opinion.

## Why GitHub
I use GitHub to simply deploy it. Once it's deployed,
you can see it anywhere. It's not anymore the local copy
of your development. 

It's one feature of GitHub and it's called GitHub Pages.
Mostly this is being used for landing pages and documentations,
even mini-blogging. And it's free. 

You also have other CMS ( like WordPress and Wix ) 
that you can deploy a website
without knowing much HTML and CSS. The downside ? 
It's limited free. Once you encounter a feature that you 
want for your site, you need to pay for it. It's not
highly customizable. On the other hand, 
using pure web core and frameworks,
you can do exactly what you want. Another downside is being
too slow that will discourage users to view your landing
page, which is a big loss particularly for businesses.

You don't need to do this deployment anymore. You will
only submit your `index.html` file.
